# Project 1  

## Topic  
Health Insurance Coverage in Maryland

## Data  
Tabular census data is available from [American FactFinder](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml) until its taken offline at the end of March, and then the new [Census Data Explorer](https://data.census.gov) thereafter. State census tract shapefiles are also available at [American FactFinder](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml), as well as through [other](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidycensus/tidycensus.pdf) [sources](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html).    

## Transformations/Subsets  
No subsetting should be necessary.    

## Analysis  
I will make two maps regarding Health Insurance coverage for 2010 and 2015: a map of the insured vs uninsured population and a map of the percent difference.  

## Outputs  
- Web map of values for each year. 
- Web map of the difference between the two years
