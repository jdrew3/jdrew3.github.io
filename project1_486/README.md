# Project 1  

## Topic  
Health Insurance Coverage

## Data  
Census data from [American FactFinder](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml) until its taken offline at the end of March, and then the new [Census Data Explorer](data.census.gov) thereafter. Shapefiles will be at the census tract level.    

## Transformations/Subsets  
I want to make a map at the country level mapping coverage and type of coverage (uninsured, private insurance, public insurance), and also one or two maps at the state level.   

## Analysis  
I will make two maps regarding Health Insurance coverage for 2010 and 2015: a map of the population broken down by the above types and a maps of spatial autocorrelation using Getis-Ord G index to distinguish autocorrelated areas of high coverage from autocorrelated areas of low coverage   

## Outputs  
- Web map of values for each year. Ideally, this will take the form of one map where the user can change the year being displayed via a menu or series of buttons.  
- The Getis-Ord maps would ideally also be part of the previous web map to enable the user to quickly switch between the values and the spatial autocorrelation for a given year.
