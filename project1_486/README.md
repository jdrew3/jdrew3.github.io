# Project 1  

## Topic  
Conducting spatial analysis of health insurance status on Zip Code Tabulation Areas versus Census Tracts

## Data  
Census data from [American FactFinder](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml) until its taken offline at the end of March, and then the new [Census Data Explorer](data.census.gov) thereafter.  

## Transformations/Subsets  
I will be subsetting Maryland to the central landmass between the Chesapeake Bay and West Virginia.  

## Analysis  
Assessing spatial autocorrelation of the amount of insured vs uninsured people by each geography.  

## Outputs  
I will be creating maps of the resulting spatial autocorrelations, and a map overlaying the two to highlight the differences.
