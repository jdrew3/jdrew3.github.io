## Health Insurance in Maryland

**Project description:** The aim of this project was to map the population of people in Maryland that have health insurance and how that's changed over time. To accomplish this, I created three maps: percent insured in 2012, percent insured in 2017, and the difference between the two. All of three of these maps can be seen as separate layers on the web map linked below. The first two were also made into their own print layout at the bottom of this page.  
  
**Tools Used:** QGIS (visualization), R (data pre-processing)   

Data Source: American Community Survey via [data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov)
