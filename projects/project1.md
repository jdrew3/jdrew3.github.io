## An "Emerald Necklace" for the UMBC Campus

**Project description:** For my GES 405 Final Project, I assessed the connectivity of green spaces of the UMBC Campus. This involved field assessment of each site, digitization of site perimeters from remote imagery, and network analysis.  
  
**Tools Used:** ArcGIS, Powerpoint  
  
**Main Takeaways:** Corridors between greenways have been shown to improve the quality of green spaces in terms of both environmental health and outdoor recreation. To bring these benefits to UMBC, an optimal green space network would need to be constructed via implemented new trails and renewing maintenance of existing ones.
