## Income Disparity in Baltimore

**Project description:** For my fourth GES 383 Lab, I analyzed data from the American Community Survey and used it to produce four maps and accompanying graphs to explore possible correlations between the racial make-up of a census tract in Baltimore and its median household income.   
  
**Tools Used:** ArcGIS, R, Adobe Illustrator  

**Main Takeaways:** Of the races considered, only percent black and percent white (non-hispanic) population were strongly correlated with median household income of a census tract. This may also reflect the relatively low asian and hispanic/latinx population in Baltimore, MD.
