## Interactive Map of Adults with Some College, No Degree in Maryland

**Project description:** I wanted to assess the distribution of 25-and-over adults in Maryland with Some College but No Degree. I used a bivariate chloropleth so that the total 25+ population can be directly compared to the percentage of those who have some college and no degree. To make it easier to display areas of interest (i.e. high population and high % SCND, etc.), I made this into an interactive R Shiny app.

**Tools Used:** R (Shiny, Leaflet)

**Main Takeaways:** The interactive legend allows the user to display only subsets of this population in Maryland based on the total people with some college and no degree within a census tract and how much of that census tract's total population is in that demographic.
