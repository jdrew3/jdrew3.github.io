## Interactive Map of Adults with Some College, No Degree in Maryland

**Project description:** I wanted to assess the distribution of 25-and-over adults in Maryland with Some College but No Degree. I used a bivariate chloropleth so that the total 25+ population can be directly compared to the percentage of those who have some college and no degree.
