## Where Can You Be Under the Poverty Line and Still Live Near a Grocery Store?

**Project description:** This interactive webmap displays the percentage of Baltimore households that are below the poverty line and are within a grocery store’s service area. The map is divided into the Community Statistical Areas (CSAs) defined by the Baltimore Neighborhood Indicator Alliance. Clicking on a given CSA lets you know its name, the median household income, and the percentage of impoverished households within a grocery store’s service area, defined as the area within a half-mile of travel from the store.  
  
**Tools Used:** QGIS  
  
**Main Takeaway:** There is next to no correlation between Median Household Income and the percentage of Baltimore households that are under the poverty line within a half-mile service area of a grocery store.
