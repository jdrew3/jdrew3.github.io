## Under the Poverty Line and Near a Grocery Store

**Project description:** Interactive map displaying percentage of Baltimore households under the poverty line within half-mile service area of a grocery store by neighborhood  
  
**Tools Used:** QGIS  
  
**Main Takeaways:** There is next to no correlation between Median Household Income and the percentage of Baltimore households that are under the poverty line within a half-mile service area of a grocery store. I had expected to see that more affluent areas would have the lower percentages since I believed that would correspond to there being less households under the poverty line overall. However, this apparent lack of a relationship may suggest that having more wealth creates less need to be within a grocery store's service area in order to have the food you require, making the mapped value less a function of the area's wealth and more a function of some other variable affecting the kinds of houses in the area around these stores and how much it costs to live there.
