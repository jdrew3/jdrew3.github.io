## The COVID-19 Crisis and the Sanders Campaign  

**Project description:** This interactive webmap a bivariate chloropleth map of the number of tweets per million people for two topics during mid-March 2020: COVID-19 and Senator Bernard Sanders. The choice of the second topic was motivated by personal observation of my twitter timeline seeing a lot of people start bringing up the promises of the Sanders campaign whenever people were the discussing the current administration's handling of the pandemic.  
  
**Tools Used:** R, QGIS  
  
**Main Takeaway:** There is a positive correlation between the states where people are tweeting about Bernie Sanders and where people are tweeting about COVID-19. This is evident through the fact that the colors of the upper left and bottom right regions of the legend do not appear on the full map, i.e. where people are tweeting a lot about one topic, they are also tweeting at least moderately about the other.
